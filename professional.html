	<h4>How i got here?</h4>
	<blockquote>Every and each individual has a need for meaningful career, a sense of fulfillment that comes from his work on regular basis.</blockquote>
	<p>After finishing higher buisness school i started working as customs/insurance agent mainly for vehicles and for quite some time that job was allright, salary was good, job required high communication skills and i was meeting new people and helping them every day, the amount of paperwork was also huge which was the downside of it. But after a while i felt into a rut, it was like doing the same thing over and over again without seeing any "me" in all that work. After 2 years i couldn't stand it, i was unhappy, unfulfilled, moody and i needed to change it for my own sake.</p>
	<p>Next step i made in my professional career was quite surprising (even to me), but i found joining the army quite appealing, it was a honorable job that required physical and psychological endurance. So i applied and got in. After few evaluations which are part of their procedure i got into heavy artillery and quicly i got trough ranks to position of aimer. Job required mathematical precision, knowledge of balistics as well as physical quickness and endurance.<br>Downside was the time consumption. Working overtime, going away for weeks, months. After almost 2 years i realised i have no life, i couldnt remember when i went out with friends to grab a beer, spent some time with family or some quality time with noone other than myself ( do something i would actually WANT to do ).</p>
	<p>Back in like 2010 i was introduced to "world" of coding, a friend of mine was front-end developer and i got onboard with finding out what is it about. I started learning the HTML, CSS and JS, the basics, and got pretty good hang of it back then since i was still "studying" and finishing school so i could actually spare some time. Anyhow, it was just a hoby and life hit back so i had to drop it and get back on course.</p>
	<p>Back to the story, after i realised its a matter of time before i leave the army i got back into coding, started reading some books ( You don't know javascript by Kyle Simpson, aka "The Bible" ) and improving my knowledge. Shortly after that i left the army cause once again i found myself in a rut, without life, time, friends? family? girlfriend? And fully dedicated myself to learning how to manipulate the client side of the browser.</p>
	<p>After almost of a year of researching, learning, improving knowledge ( yes, im a self taugth person ) i got into freelancing with a quite more experienced friend of mine where i experienced real project requests, adapted to change my approach to each problem from different angles, as a user and developer ( quite often designer as well ) and shaped my knowledge into something that would be hard to achive only from courses and reading books.</p>
	<p>Freelancing kept me going for over a year and a half, lots of different projects, each of them was a challenge on its own. Income was satisfying, job was fun, but im a "workoholic" type of person capeable of turning my life into a job, so i was finding myself working overtime, all the time and thats when i decided i need to change my work surrounding. I thought working with people would benefit my knowledge and overall social life, which it did, interactions with coleagues, solving problems in person, sharing experiences, competing and problem solving as a team is a bit more fun. That is why im very thankful to the company and the team im working with every single day.</p>
	<p>When i take a look back at copule of years i spent on web development, i can say that i really like my job and i LOVE getting better at it and i can see myself doing it for the rest of my life. Each new project brings new experience, knowledge, either framework, library, just a plain css trick or overall patience in debugging which inprove problem solving skills, it is colorful and different, and im pretty sure this type of career commitment has a "fuel" to keep me going for quite some time.</p>
	<p>Im guessing leaving that a digital fingerprint somewhere on the web has brought some kind of meaning to my professional career. My work, my effort and my commitment is visible somewhere, it cant be touched but it can be seen and used to make someone's life easier and that is what brings sense of fulfillment and pleasure to my career.</p>
